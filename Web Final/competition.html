        <h3>Computers</h3>
         <p> While the personal computer running on Microsoft operating systems has remained a favorite of consumers since the 1980s, Apple has maintained a loyal following of users who report high satisfaction with the company's Macintosh computers and Safari operating system. Major competitors in this space include Dell, Acer, HP, Sony, and Toshiba.</p>


              <h3>Entertainment and Multi Media Apps</h3>
         <p> The two major players in this space are Apple and Google, with the Apple iOS running on its iPhones and iPods, and Google Android running on most competitor phones and tablets. Each operating system interfaces with iTunes and the Google Play Store respectively, allowing users to purchase music, books, applications and other media </p>

              <h3>Smartphones</h3>
         <p> The smartphone industry was once dominated by Canadian giant BlackBerry Limited (BBRY) (formerly Research in Motion Limited). That changed quickly with the introduction of the Apple iPhone. The iPhone has literally decimated BlackBerry's business model and caused the company to restructure several times. Alphabet Inc.'s Google produces the Android operating system, which is installed on most non-Apple phones produced by Huawei, Samsung, Sony (SNE), HTC, Lenovo, and others./</p>
