                  <h3>iPhone</h3>
                  <p>Apple has ten generations of iPhone models. The original iPhone was a GSM phone that introduced the one button and bigger screen idea. The came the iPhone 3G which added 3G network support, and was followed by the 3GS with improved hardware, the 4 with a metal chassis, higher display resolution and front-facing camera, and the 4S with improved hardware and the voice assistant Siri. The iPhone 5 was then introduced with its new 4 inch display and nre lighting port charging adapter. It was later accompanied by the iPhone 5c and 5s in 2013; the iPhone 5c was a cost effective iPhone while the iPhone 5s was a newer model of the 5 and included a fingerprint scanner. In 2014, the iPhone 6 models came wotj 4.7 and 5.5-inch displays. The iPhone 6S was introduced the following year, which featured hardware upgrades and support for pressure-sensitive touch inputs, as well as the SE—which featured hardware from the 6S but the smaller form factor of the 5S. In 2016, Apple unveiled the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, which add water resistance, improved system and graphics performance, a new rear dual-camera setup on the Plus model, and new color options, while removing the 3.5 mm headphone jack found on previous models.</p>
