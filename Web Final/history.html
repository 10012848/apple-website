        <p> Apple was founded by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne on April 1976 to develop and sell computers and was incorporated as Apple Computer, Inc in January, 1977. Apple went public in 1980 with stupendoes success in their business. Over the next few years, Apple developed computers featuring innovative graphical user interfaces However, the high price tag of its products and limited software titles caused problems. After being left by his peers, Jobs resigned Apple and created his own company. More executive job shuffles happened at Apple until Gil Amelio in 1997 decided to buy Jobs' company to bring him back. Jobs regained position as CEO, and began a process to rebuild Apple's status, which included opening Apple's own retail stores in 2001, making numerous acquisitions of software companies to create a portfolio of software titles, and changed some of the hardware technology used in its computers. It again saw success and returned to profitability. In January 2007, Jobs announced that Apple Computer, Inc. would be renamed Apple Inc. to reflect its shifted focus toward consumer electronics, and announced the iPhone, which saw critical acclaim and significant financial success. </p>
